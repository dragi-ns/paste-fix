# Paste Fix

Primarily made to remove irregular whitespace characters, which we get when we copy and paste content from OneNote.

## Features

- Automatically replaces (the user can opt out in the settings) irregular whitespaces when **pasting** content.
- Adds "Replace Irregular Whitespaces" command which replaces all irregular whitespaces in the current active document.
